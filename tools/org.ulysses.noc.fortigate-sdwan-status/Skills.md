# FortiGate SD-WAN Status Tool

## Purpose
Diagnostic tool for retrieving real-time SD-WAN operational status from FortiGate devices. Provides unified view of health check probes, SD-WAN members, BGP neighbors, and IPsec tunnels.

Based on FortiOS monitor API endpoints for live operational data.

## When to Use
- Troubleshooting SD-WAN path selection issues
- Verifying health check probe status (latency, jitter, packet loss)
- Checking BGP neighbor session states
- Validating IPsec tunnel connectivity
- Quick health assessment of SD-WAN overlay network

## What It Shows

### Health Check Probes
Real-time SLA metrics from SD-WAN health checks:
```

│   ├── Jitter: 2.1ms
│   └── Packet Loss: 0%
└── Member: HUB2-VPN2
    ├── Status: alive
    ├── Latency: 12.8ms
    └── Jitter: 1.5ms
```

### BGP Neighbors
BGP session states and route counts:
```
Neighbor: 172.16.255.253
├── State: Established

## Interpreting Results

### Health Check States
| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| alive | Probe responding, SLA may or may not be met |
| dead | Probe not responding |

### BGP States
| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Established | Session up, routes exchanging |
| Connect | TCP connection attempt |
| Active | Waiting for connection |
| Idle | Session not started |
| OpenSent | OPEN message sent |
| OpenConfirm | OPEN received, waiting confirmation |

### IPsec States
| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| up | Tunnel established |
| down | Tunnel not established |
| connecting | Negotiation in progress |

## Troubleshooting Scenarios

### Health Check Dead
1. Check IPsec tunnel status - Phase2 must be up
2. Verify firewall policy allows probe traffic
3. Check health check server IP is reachable
4. Verify probe protocol (ping/http/dns)

### BGP Stuck in Connect
1. Check IPsec tunnel - must be Phase2 up
2. Verify BGP neighbor IP is correct
3. Check firewall policy for BGP (TCP 179)
4. Verify AS numbers match configuration

### IPsec Phase2 Down
1. Check Phase1 status first
2. Verify Phase2 selectors match
3. Check for PSK mismatch
4. Review IPsec logs: `diagnose vpn ike log-filter dst-addr4 <peer_ip>`
